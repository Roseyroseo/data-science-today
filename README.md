# The Current State of Data Science: Tools of the Trade, Compensation and Representation

This is a project for the DSC190 course at the University of California San Diego

As Data Science & Machine Learning evolves as one of the most dynamic and impactful domains in technology, we want to analyze trends and patterns using the 2020 Kaggle DS & ML Survey, which gathered responses from over 20,000 participants across 171 countries and territories. The survey provides information capturing the experiences, aspirations, and tools of individuals engaged in or aspiring to work within the data science ecosystem.
